# Information Retrieval Project

Project done for the information retrieval course of the master's degree in Data Science @ UniMI

## Topic chosen - Soccer Event Detection (P13)

> <p align="justify"> An event is a specific occurrence of something that happens in a certain time and a certain place involving one or more participants, which can frequently be described as a change of state. The goal of event detection is to identify event instance(s) in data and, if existing, identify the event type as well as all of its participants and attributes. The goal of the project is to correctly classify test images: the model should be able to discern between soccer-related events and general images, and also classify the specific event occurring.</p>
